# 🧠 NEURA - Neural Entity for Understanding, Reasoning, and Autonomy

NEURA is a cutting-edge LLM-powered agent framework that simulates autonomous reasoning and task execution across multiple environments. Built with LangGraph and modern AI technologies, NEURA provides a robust foundation for creating intelligent, autonomous agents.

## 🌟 Features

- 🤖 **Multi-Modal Agent Framework**: Support for web, CLI, API, and local knowledge base interactions
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**: Easily plug in different LLMs, memory modules, and tools
- 🔄 **Autonomous Reasoning**: Task decomposition and planning capabilities
- 📚 **Memory Management**: Vector DB and file-based memory for long-term learning
- 🔌 **Extensible Environment Support**: Operate in local, cloud, or hybrid environments
- 🤝 **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Support for agent composition and collaboration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Poetry (for dependency management)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neura.git
cd neura
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Quick Start

```python
from neura.agents import PlannerAgent, ExecutorAgent
from neura.core.graph import create_agent_graph

# Create agent graph
graph = create_agent_graph(
    planner=PlannerAgent(),
    executor=ExecutorAgent()
)

# Run the agent
result = graph.run("Research the latest developments in quantum computing")
```
