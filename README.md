# neura-agent
NEURA is an LLM-powered agent framework designed to simulate autonomous reasoning and task execution across multiple environmentsâ€”web, CLI, API, and local knowledge bases. It acts like a "thinking assistant" capable of decomposing tasks, deciding when to ask vs. act, and using memory for long-term utility.
